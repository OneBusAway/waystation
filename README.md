Waystation is a transit information display that provides reliable, real-time arrival and departure times at bus stops, train stations, and transit hubs.

For agencies, Waystation is the next-generation *Sign Mode* for the [OneBusAway project](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway/wiki)—a ready-to-deploy application designed for continuous, long-term operation. It is developed with the needs of transit agencies in mind, providing a dependable and low-maintenance system for delivering real-time rider information.

For developers, Waystation is designed to be straightforward to install, configure, and extend. It is implemented with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/), internationalized with [inlang Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs), and relies on [OneBusAway APIs](https://github.com/OneBusAway/js-sdk) as its primary data source.
